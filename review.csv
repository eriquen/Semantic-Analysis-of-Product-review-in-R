TP-Link Wifi,"For a home network with a PC w/Win7 wired and 4+ iPads and iPhones with an existing Apple Airport extreme and a remote Airport express, where the internet speed was 89 down 6 up at the PC, the wireless speed was the same 3' from the router dropping to 45 down 6 up on the floor above, and 15 down 5 up at the most remote location, this device increased the speed to 89 down 6 up at all locations. Not sure how far down the street it will extend.
Most important was ease of setup, downloaded the Tether app as instructed and followed instructions-painless.",2018
TP-Link Wifi,"It worked OK for several weeks, then wifi started failing, now every minute it tries to reboot. I updated firmware, power turn off and on several times, still didn't work. Returning the item.",2018
TP-Link Wifi,"I specifically checked for WDS supporting on AX10 and saw TP-link official support CONFIRMED it, but only to find out that it is NOT. Such a waste of time, dishonest and disappointed.",2018
TP-Link Wifi,"Super easy to install. Finally upgraded my router after using my Netgear one from 2013. App is useful to change passwords, block devices, manage devices and more!",2018
TP-Link Wifi,"Gives a stronger, wider signal then a junky mesh system we tried. Covers our entire house and even into the yard so we’re very happy with it. Has an Intel chip so should last a long time.",2019
TP-Link Wifi,This router does not support Alexa. TP-link compatibility list dont include this router. please correct the information,2019
TP-Link Wifi,"Easy to set up, but I don’t notice any speed difference. Hopefully it will stay reliable.",2019
TP-Link Wifi,"I waited to use this router After a week and be sure of its stability before writing this review. I cannot be more satisfied!
I have been seeking a WIFI 6 router for over a year to replace my 6 years old N branded R7000 that started showing signs of failure. I tried 2 WIFI 6 type of the same N branded and got frustrated with the installation. I returned them. Then I ran into the TP-Link WIFI 6 at $70 after tax! I didn’t have much a high expectation due to this incredible price.
The installation is simple to replace my existing router. Immediately, I am up to speed. The signal coverage reaches every corner of my single story 2200 sqft house. My internet is 500Mbps, at off hour time I get 550, at pick hour I get 270.
The UI is simple not fancy but does the job. I like to schedule reboot feature.
Overall I strongly recommend this router",2019
TP-Link Wifi,I had bought lots of tp-link products before and they all have worked very good. But the experience with this router is very disappointing. I wanted to get a wifi 6 router for sharing the high speed internet in my home and this router kept restarting on its own. Did a lot of resetting and restarting and it did not work. The same issue of the router restarting. All the lights will go off and the router will again start connecting with the modem.,2019
TP-Link Wifi,Totally awesome this router paired up with tp link ax3000 desktop wifi 6 card I'm getting more than I'm paying for with spectrum I'm only paying for 400 Mbps and in getting just a little over 400 Mbps,2020
TP-Link Wifi,"I've had this router for a week and already the wifi has disconnected several times. I do not recommend this router at all. When it works, the speeds are fine. If only it worked consistently.",2020
TP-Link Wifi,Purchased this router because I was having to reboot my old router multiple times each day and was becoming a headache. Since I’ve had this router I don’t think it’s needed reset once. I’m getting about 50 MBPS faster (450 vs 400) than with my old router when performing speed test from my WiFi 6 enabled smartphone. Also enjoy the app that has many useful features and user friendly. If you are looking for a great budget WiFi 6 router I highly recommend this.,2020
TP-Link Wifi,"I followed all instructions for this router and for some reason our devices kept getting kicked off randomly. We were well below the number of devices this router was supposed to be able to handle. Even with prioritizing certain ones, like the phones, they'd get kicked. And it's not always easy to tell right away with the phones because when they get kicked off they switch to data (which is an issue when trying to save data!) My wifi-only tablet, which stays at home, was constantly being dropped. I ended up replacing this with a Netgear router after a week of headaches. The Netgear works great and no problems. This router really drove me crazy trying to troubleshoot it. I hardly ever write bad reviews but this router was so aggravating.",2020
TP-Link Wifi,"Couldn’t keep a WiFi signal. Customer support couldn’t do anything for me. Buyer beware, if you get a lemon- TP - Link will not honor their product. Bought in February 2020 and garbage by end of March 2020. Amazon won’t accept a return or trade by less than a month.",2020
ASUS Gaming Router,"This could easily be 5/5 stars but it's getting a crappy 1/5 stars for:
The advance features of this model doesn't specify that all my web traffic is enforced to be sent to Trend Micro. No privacy rights. Can't enable the features w/o having all your web traffic logged. No thank you. This had the best layout and very rich features which I desired the most but not at the expense of my freedom of privacy.",2018
ASUS Gaming Router,"Bought this router 1/11/2018 avoided doing the firmware update since my previous ASUS router j use dropped the 2.4 ghz wireless network after the update. AC 3200 started dropping the 2.4 ghz after one month so I bit the bullet and updated the firmware and lo and behold I had no wireless at all. Standing next to the router there was not a single SSID from the router being broadcast. Thank e 2.4 and both 5. GHz bans just stopped. Reset the router to factory setting with the reset button on the back of the router and re-entered all the set up information and still nothing. In stalled my old Cisco N router and we were back online as well as our connected home devises. Second ASUS router now and although the great ratings sold me on these routers, they are my last . Also Amazon’s lumping together the reviews for manufactures devices makes the research process near impossible. Read carefully ",2018
ASUS Gaming Router,fter four months this VERY expensive router quit working. But the reason for the 1 star is the horrendous Asus service. They make it impossible to get an RMA to send it in for repair. They also make it impossible to register the product. When you try to enter the serial number you get a message saying that the serial number is wrong. I took a picture of the s/n and magnified it and tried every possible way it could be entered and it kept giving me the message that the s/n is wrong. You cannot get an RMA because you get the same message that the s/n is wrong. I am seriously considering small claims court because of my time that was wasted. Rarely do I write a review but this product deserves it so that other people will not have the same problems.,2018
ASUS Gaming Router,"his is an expensive router, but after using it, I've replaced all of my routers with this one. I have a particularly large home. Mesh networks have proven to be unreliable in the past. I've used Linksys Velop, Eero, and Google WiFi mesh networks. I have gigabit internet, and none of those mesh networks were able to provide more than ~100Mbps throughout my home. I then tried just one of these Asus routers. It covered most of my home, only instead of ~100Mbps like the mesh routers, I was now getting ~600Mbps. I then decided to purchase another to fill the last little gap in coverage, since these support ASUS AiMesh. Now my entire home has extremely fast WiFi. Even when connected to the second node, I still am able to pull ~400Mbps down. That's incredible!",2018
ASUS Gaming Router,"I replaced an older Linksys router with this ASUS router. I think this router is the best I've owned. It has 3 reliable WiFi bands, good coverage, ample ports, and many options that allow expert configuration to optimize how you use this router. In my situation, I keep it rather simple. I only use about 50% of the advanced features / capabilities of the router; however, the things many users look for are great. The WiFi covers my 3 bedroom house. The ports provide ample connectivity and configurations that fit my needs. ASUS provides excellent support for the software, and I have had no issues with anything to date. The user interface is simple, easy to navigate and provides good definitions for most of the options available. I have had zero issues with this router. My Samsung Galaxy S10+ connects well at 1083 MB/s, as do most of my other devices depending on their capabilities. If you want a good solid router with many extra features that will stay with the technology curve, this is a great choice.",2018
ASUS Gaming Router,"My last one was so good to me that I almost cried when it died in a lightning storm / blackout. I was looking to see if it was worth the upgrade to the newer GT-AX11000, but couldn't justify that price, along with the fact that the gaming community has little firmware support for it, and no Asuswrt-Merlin firmware (my favorite firmware for routers), made it an easy pass. Also wasn't too keen on trying out new waters after spending that much money from what I've heard about the lack of improvement from the 5300. It just shows you how great this router is, and ASUS has done an excellent job with this one. Someday I'll probably upgrade to a newer model or even the AX11000 once they get more support, but as of now, with the reliable speeds I get and the longevity of this router, it's well worth it for me to stick with the 5300. Best router I've owned!",2019
ASUS Gaming Router,"I purchased this router to upgrade an old router that gave me 600 mbps speeds on a new gigabit connection. I have consistently had speeds of 850-950 mbps after upgrading. This was over 2 years ago. The device is still running well and doesn't need reset regularly as the previous did. The firmware options are pretty good and anyone with networking experience will find this device pretty capable. VPN support, mesh, etc.",2019
ASUS Gaming Router,"Works kind of, all the features advertised do work the range is what I would expect out of a home router unite. Overall design and build quality seems to merit the price point.
Now the reason for the review. At first I assumed was an issue with my internet service provider then later discovered was an issue with this router. I must admit that I was blinded initially by the price point of this system to its ultimate fault. For some reason this all in one router likes to reboot once a day without being prompted to. Tried to fix it though standard trouble shooting, made sure the software was up to date, reset and setup minimum settings with no change. Check the web and found others with the same issues with no fix listed. Ultimately this wouldn't be an issue if I wasn't a power user of the internet in addition to my room mates, but we are and when your connection drops for a minute when your an hour into an online match one time that is enough to make me replace the unite with a professional solution.",2019
ASUS Gaming Router,"I found a few let downs that should be part of the updates. 1 - You cannot Subnet out each WIRELESS network to keep them truly separate from each other. 2 - You cannot separate them within VLAN. 3 - In the AI Mesh environment only the main WIRELESS network is expanded to the second router? Why? Who thinks your main network should be the one you broadcast and allow family and friends to join? The range is great, but the developers need to think past gaming and more everyday impact in the home. Different network for the Kids, Webcams, guest or your own media network.",2019
ASUS Gaming Router,"The ASUS RT-AC3200 is a decent unit and I'd like to say that I like it a lot more, but it does tend to drop signals pretty often and that gets annoying. I will have to purchase another expensive ASUS product, a range extender, so that this will reach everywhere in my 2,000 sq. ft. 2-story home. For the rooms close to it, it does a much better job than my old NETGEAR N600 Dual Band Wi-Fi Router (WNDR3400) did, as far as speed goes, but range is not near as good as my old unit. Still, I would recommend this unit or some of their similar units, especially if you can centrally locate it inside of your house.",2019
ASUS Gaming Router,Our router only lasted 6 months. It was awesome and we loved it until it stopped working and the power cord to it stopped working. I will update the review once I see how long the new one lasts. It is an expensive router to only last six months,2020
ASUS Gaming Router,"hus router is fast and full of features. However, I have experienced lower signal quality, as well as issues when ""hopping"" from 5ghz to the 2.4 ghz bands. The smart connect isn't as smooth as it could be, nor is there much documentation on configuration of it to make it better. The parental controls are primarily why we purchased this, and the time limit feature works great for our teenagers.",2020
ASUS Gaming Router,"I'm somewhat disappointed in this router because for the amount of money I paid, its performance has been less than expected. I am getting constant delays and buffering although I have Cox's upper bandwidth plans. I called Cox and they told me my signal was great and that the problem was more than likely with my router. I love all the features but there useless unless you know how to configure.",2020
ASUS Gaming Router,"The device is, to say it lightly, HUGE. Now the fun stuff, I had the NetGear AC1900 which I loved, for me it was something simple that I loved. It was that it monitored my usage per month. The amount bandwidth, I have yet to figure this part out with my new AC5300.. I still have a few more days with it and if I dont like it for whatever reason I think I might return it for a different brand, maybe its just ASUS software that doesnt support what I am looking for. Any help form Tech from this point would be helpful",2020
ASUS Gaming Router,Had problems with connecting it to Verizon Fios. Had to return it. Ended up buying Verizon's Quantum router.,2020
